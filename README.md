## 🏙️ About the Project

This project was built as part of the **Scrimba FullStack Career Path**.  
The goal was to create a **random password generator** using JavaScript, styled to match the original **Figma design** provided in the course.

The app generates **two secure random passwords** when the button is clicked.  
The design focuses on strong visual contrast, bold typography, and clean layout using **Flexbox**.

## 💡 What I Learned

* Selecting DOM elements with `getElementById`
* Listening for button clicks with **`addEventListener`**
* Updating input values dynamically with `.value`
* Working with arrays of characters for password generation
* Using **Math.random()** + **Math.floor()** for randomness
* Creating functions that return dynamic values (`getPassword`)
* Styling with **Flexbox**, spacing, shadows, and accessible contrast
* Loading fonts from **Google Fonts** (Karla & Inter)
* Using `readonly` inputs for display-only UI fields
* ✨ **BONUS learn**: Instead of using a `for` loop as suggested, I learned and applied  
  `Array.from()` to generate an array dynamically — reinforcing modern JavaScript concepts and array creation techniques.

> *This project helped solidify my understanding of DOM interaction, arrays, and event-driven UI updates.*

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I’m currently strengthening my **core frontend fundamentals** in  
**HTML + CSS + JavaScript** before moving deeper into more advanced stacks.

Choosing to use `Array.from()` instead of a manual loop was intentional —  
I wanted to explore different ways of generating sequences in JS and reinforce my understanding of modern array methods.

If you'd like to **give feedback or review my code**, I’d really appreciate it! 🙌

> *"Consistency over complexity — building one small concept at a time."*
